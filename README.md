# 🌿 Species Segmentation with Cluster Analysis (Part 1) - Exercise 🌿

## 📌 Overview
This exercise is part of my Udemy Data Science learning journey, focusing on **unsupervised learning** techniques. In this project, I performed **K-Means clustering** to segment species based on their features. The **Elbow Method** was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Iris dataset**, which contains:
- **150 samples** of iris flowers
- **4 numerical features**:
  - 🌱 Sepal length (cm)
  - 🌿 Sepal width (cm)
  - 🌸 Petal length (cm)
  - 🌼 Petal width (cm)
- **3 classes (species)**:
  - 🏵️ Iris-setosa
  - 🌺 Iris-versicolor
  - 🌻 Iris-virginica

## 🛠 Tools Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**
- 🏷️ **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn** (for implementing K-Means clustering)

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **📥 Data Loading**
   - The dataset was imported and explored using Pandas.
2. **🔧 Data Preprocessing**
   - Checked for missing values and scaled the data.
3. **📏 Choosing the Number of Clusters**
   - The **Elbow Method** was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. **🌀 Applying K-Means Clustering**
   - The dataset was clustered based on feature similarities.
5. **📊 Visualization**
   - Scatter plots were created to analyze cluster distributions.

## 📈 Results
- The **Elbow Method** indicated that the optimal number of clusters was **3**.
- The K-Means model successfully segmented the species based on their features.
